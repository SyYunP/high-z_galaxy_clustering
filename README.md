# High-z galaxy clustering

https://github.com/SyYunP/high-z_galaxy_correlation

This repository contains datasets presented in [Pu et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2410.02524), in which fitting methods and the initial cosmological setups of the simulation we used are described.

We provide here four sets of correlation function measurements for z = 2 and 3 galaxies with different masses, along with the corresponding fitting results, in each directory. 

In the `measurement.txt` files, the first rows are the mean separation between galaxies within each bin; the second rows and third rows are the monopole and quadrupole correlation functions, respectively. 

Note that `z3_125_135` files are with bin size = 10 Mpc, instead of 5 Mpc as in the other datasets.
